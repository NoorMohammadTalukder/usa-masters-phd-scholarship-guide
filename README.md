# üéì How To Secured a Fully Funded Masters/PhD Scholarship in the USA

Welcome! This guide walks through the steps I personally followed to secure a fully funded Ph.D. scholarship in the United States ‚Äî from university selection to contacting professors, and from preparing documents to showcasing your profile effectively.

---

## üõ† Step 1: Find the Right University

- Aim for **well-ranked universities** ‚Äî higher-ranked universities help during the visa process.
- Use reliable ranking platforms like:
  - [US News National University Rankings](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities)
- Shortlist universities that match your research interests and profile.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Step 2: Connect with Prospective Professors (POI - Professors of Interest)

There are two major funding routes:
1. **University Central Fund** ‚Äì Usually more competitive.
2. **Professor-Managed Research Grants** ‚Äì More accessible if your research aligns.

### üì© Email Professors Strategically
- Search for professors in your area of interest. Use Google like:
[University Name] + [Department] + Faculty
Example: Princeton University Computer Science Department Faculty


- Check their **university profiles** and **Google Scholar** to understand their recent work.
- Target 9 AM local time in the professor‚Äôs timezone to increase email open rates.
- Expect a low reply rate. I received 2‚Äì3 responses from over 50 emails.

### üìÑ What to Include in Your Email
- Subject: `Prospective PhD Applicant ‚Äì Research Interest in [Topic]`
- Introduction (your degree, GPA, background)
- Research alignment with their lab
- Attach:
- **CV**
- **Transcript**
- Mention your interest in joining their lab and how you could contribute
**N.B: Keep your email short and focus on main topic. Professor usually don't have time to read a full email.**

## üß™ Step 3: Research & Academic Profile

A strong research and academic background is one of the most critical parts of your application. Even if your work is **not published**, you can still create impact by aligning your **projects** and **research interests** with your target professor's work.

### üî¨ What Counts as Research Experience?
- A **published paper** is a big plus.
- But even if you only have **ongoing research** or **academic projects**, they can still matter **if aligned well** with the professor‚Äôs field.

### üéØ How to Present Your Research
- Mention your thesis or academic project in your email:
> ‚ÄúI have worked on a capstone project involving machine learning for disease prediction, which I believe aligns with your work on health informatics.‚Äù

- If your research is unpublished:
- Describe the **problem**, **method**, and **findings**
- Connect it to the professor's research

### üìå Example Alignment Table

| Your Background                   | Professor's Work               | How to Align                             |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Heart disease prediction project | Medical AI                     | Shared interest in healthcare systems    |
| UX in education research         | Learning analytics             | Highlight HCI and education design       |
| NLP coursework + Python skills   | Natural Language Processing    | Match technical and academic interests   |

## üí¨ Step 4: Prepare English Test Scores

- **GRE**: Optional at many universities. I did **not** submit GRE.
- **IELTS/TOEFL**: Mandatory for most international students
- For TA (Teaching Assistantship) roles, aim for **7.0‚Äì7.5** in **Speaking**
